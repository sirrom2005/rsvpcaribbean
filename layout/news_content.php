<p>On May 23, 2016 the RSVP Team provided clothing, toiletries and food supplies to three families in need. We visited the community 
of Cocoa Walk in South Manchester, Jamaica with food supplies (flour, sugar, non-perishable canned items, oil, snacks, milk and other items), 
clothing for adults and children and a heart full of love.</p>
<p>The first stop was Miss Dotty, her five (5) children were eager to show us their surroundings and the 
children shared with us their likes and dislikes, dreams and aspirations. We stopped to pick some ackees (national dish for Jamaica) 
as the tree was laden with many just waiting for us to dig in.</p>
<p>Miss Dotty then followed us to Miss Claudine, where we were greeted by the bright smiles of three (3) children. We soon 
found Miss Claudine who expressed how grateful she was that we had taken the time to visit and to provide well need items for her 
family. In total, Miss Claudine has five (5) children, 12 years and under and she is desperately in need to assistance as the house 
they are living in is unsafe and poses personal and health risks to the family. Through the RSVP Change a Life Project we are mobilizing 
resources to assist her with building a new home. We are also trying to secure a job for her so she can use her hairdressing skills 
to sustain her family.</p>
<p>We then journeyed to Miss Salome who lives with her son and grand daughter. It was a 20 minute walk as the road was in such 
a bad condition we had to park the car. When we got to Miss Salome she was busy sweeping her yard and making her surroundings clean 
and tidy. It was a very fruitful property with guinep, papaya, mangoes and many other fruits and vegetables. She is a farmer and tries 
to provide for her family. Her house was destroyed by the last hurricane and she fears the remaining section will collapse at anytime. 
We could see that the house was in urgent need of repairs. We spent sometime with her just getting to know her more and sharing words of 
encouragement.</p>
<p>This was definitely a day that we will always treasure as in our process of giving we were reminded that nothing should be taken for 
granted. We will definitely be following up as time goes by to help in any way possible.</p>
<p>If you would like to help these families please email <a href="mailto:foundation@rsvpcaribbean.com">foundation@rsvpcaribbean.com</a>.</p>
