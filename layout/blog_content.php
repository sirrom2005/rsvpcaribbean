<p>Every region has its own unique culture and way of life. Each island within the Caribbean offers a one of a kind experience but as a 
region there are a few things that the islands have in common. In this blog we want to share with you a little about the people of the Caribbean .</p>
<p>The people of the Caribbean are easy going, warm and friendly. They take a gloomy day and make it pleasurable, they take a dull moment and make it 
extraordinary, they take a rainy day and make it into a family fun-filled day and they take a serious moment and  somehow find the humour in it. 
Despite various hardships, Caribbean people are eternal optimists who tend to look at the brighter side, prefer to see the glass as half full and 
explore opportunities that emerge from hardships. There is acknowledgement of the current situation but also a glimmer of hope that things can change - so 
the people will positively twist situations and "make fashion" to survive.</p><p>With phrases like "never a dull moment", "no problem" and "everything a 
everything", there is the collective determination of the people to see the good in everything and so push beyond their limits and achieve  great success 
just by believing that all things are possible. A rainy day may cause gloom to many but not for Caribbean people as this is a time to get creative with games 
and invent recipes. There are some traditional menus for a rainy day such as soup, dumplings and curried chicken or rice with mackerel. Nothing is ever very 
serious to a Caribbean person, they see humour in everything and will always qualify something with a disclaimer "it is not funny but." If everything is taken 
too seriously what a stiff region this would be so we lighten up things a bit.</p><p>Strong, resilient, creative, warm, fun, talented and determined are just 
some of the words to describe the people of the Caribbean but don\'t just take our word for it come and see for yourself. </p><p><b>So why not Respond... and 
come to Discover more about the people of the Caribbean.</b></p>
