<p>There are many children who are in need of basic school supplies to assist them in preparing for school. With increased cost basic school 
supplies are unaffordable for some families in the Caribbean. At RSVP we believe that each child deserves the same opportunity to hone knowledge, 
skills and talents. This simple but important gesture can help to break the cycle of poverty and give each child a fair chance to learn, grow and excel.</p>
<p>As such we are embarking on the RSVP Back to School Project. This is held August each year and the actual event will be on Thursday, 
August 25, 2016 at 10:00am. The items needed include notebooks, pens, pencils, rulers, erasers, art and craft supplies, knapsack/rucksack, 
socks (black, brown, blue), shoes (sizes 3-9), hair accessories and other supplies.</p>
<p>The RSVP Team will be going to poor and vulnerable communities to distribute these school supplies.</p>
<p>Contact us today at 876 596 5918 or <a href="mailto:foundation@rsvpcaribbean.com">foundation@rsvpcaribbean.com</a> if you would like to 
donate items for this worthy cause.</p>
